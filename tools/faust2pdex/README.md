# faust2pdex

Generator of faust wrappers for Puredata

## Description

This software wraps the C++ code generated by faust into a native external for Puredata.
You obtain a piece of source code that you can use with [pd-lib-builder](https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder) to produce a native binary with the help of `make`. No knowledge of C++ programming is required.

This program is an alternative to the Puredata builder shipped with faust.
Using this software, you can have control on some elements of the generation, such as how you would like the parameters to be arranged.

## Usage

You may use a `Makefile` similar to the following:
```
class.sources = my-external~.cc
include Makefile.pdlibbuilder
```

Assuming you have written the faust source `my-external.dsp`, you may first use `faust` to process this file into C++.
(note: don't forget to pass faust the flag `-double` if your processor needs additional precision)

```
faust my-external.dsp > my-external.cc
```

Next, open `my-external.dsp` with `faust2pdex`. Customize as you like, and generate code into `my-external~.cc`.

Please note: the names of the controls have to be unique as well as their symbols. Otherwise, the external will not work.

Be careful: if your inputs, outputs, or controls are modified in the faust source, you will have to regenerate the wrapper.
